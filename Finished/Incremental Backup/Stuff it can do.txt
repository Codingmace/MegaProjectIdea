The things that it can do right now
It can compress a folder of files and each one writes the file so it can decompress
The decompress function has been partly written but not neccessary works because on time crunch and believe with the information given I could write it easily.
See the GUI that added to when editing it the second time

Issues that it can
- If the zip file is corrupted
- If the zip file has a password
- If there is any reason for it to stop for any reason
- If there is a slight differencce in naing
- If there is an issue with the format of the file name
- If the file is named zip but not in the right format (Minor)
